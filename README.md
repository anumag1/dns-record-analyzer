# DNS Records Analyzer

A Python tool for analyzing DNS records, focusing on email security mechanisms such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. This script helps identify potential vulnerabilities in email configurations for a given domain and provides a comprehensive report with recommendations for improving email security.

## Features

- Fetches and analyzes the following DNS records:
  - SPF (Sender Policy Framework) records to verify email sender authorization.
  - DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) records for message authentication.
  - DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) records for email policy enforcement.
  - DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) to verify the integrity of DNS data.
  - MX (Mail Exchange) records to ensure proper email server setup.
- Identifies potential vulnerabilities in email configurations, such as:
  - Missing or misconfigured SPF records.
  - Absence of DKIM records for certain selectors.
  - Weak DMARC policies (e.g., "p=none").
  - Lack of DNSSEC.
  - Insufficient MX records.
- Provides a detailed report summarizing the findings and possible vulnerabilities.
- Supports various common DKIM selectors for enhanced scanning.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `dnspython` library

You can install the required library using pip:

```
pip install dnspython
```

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/anumag1/dns-records-analyzer.git
cd dns-records-analyzer
```

## Usage

Run the script from the command line, providing the domain you want to analyze:

```
python dcheck.py <domain>
```

Replace `<domain>` with the actual domain you want to check (e.g., example.com).

### Example:

```
python dcheck.py example.com
```

## Functions

### `get_dns_record(domain: str, record_type: str) -> Optional[List[str]]`

Retrieves the specified DNS record for a domain. Supports multiple record types such as `TXT`, `MX`, and `DNSKEY`.

### `analyze_mx(domain: str) -> Tuple[List[str], List[str]]`

Analyzes the MX records for the domain and checks for potential vulnerabilities such as insufficient or missing MX records.

### `analyze_spf(spf_record: Optional[str]) -> Tuple[List[str], List[str]]`

Analyzes the SPF record for potential misconfigurations, such as allowing all servers to send emails (`+all`), soft fail settings (`~all`), and missing mechanisms.

### `analyze_dkim(domain: str) -> Tuple[List[str], List[str]]`

Analyzes DKIM records for various common selectors (e.g., `default`, `selector1`, `mail`, etc.) and checks for the presence and correctness of DKIM records.

### `analyze_dmarc(domain: str) -> Tuple[Optional[List[str]], List[str]]`

Analyzes the DMARC record for the domain, identifying weaknesses like the absence of reporting URIs (`rua`) or a lenient policy (e.g., `p=none`).

### `analyze_dnssec(domain: str) -> Tuple[Optional[List[str]], List[str]]`

Checks whether DNSSEC is enabled by verifying the presence of DNSKEY records. If DNSSEC is not enabled, it flags the domain as vulnerable.

### `generate_report(domain: str) -> str`

Generates a comprehensive report of the DNS record analysis, including any detected vulnerabilities and recommendations for improving email security.

### `parse_arguments()`

Parses command-line arguments to accept the domain input.

## Analyzed Record Types

### SPF

The SPF record allows domain owners to specify which IP addresses are authorized to send email on behalf of their domain. This tool checks for misconfigurations such as:

- Missing SPF record.
- Overly permissive settings like `+all`.
- Soft fail mechanisms like `~all`.

### DKIM

DKIM allows emails to be cryptographically signed using a private key. The script looks for common DKIM selectors and checks for proper DKIM record formatting.

### DMARC

DMARC helps enforce policies on how emails should be handled if they fail SPF and DKIM checks. The tool verifies if a DMARC record is present and whether the policy is set to `none`, `quarantine`, or `reject`.

### DNSSEC

DNSSEC ensures the authenticity and integrity of DNS data. The tool checks for the presence of DNSSEC records to confirm whether a domain has DNSSEC enabled.

### MX Records

MX records are essential for routing emails. The tool checks if a domain has MX records configured and whether they are sufficient for proper email routing.

## Example Output

Below is an example of the toolâ€™s output for analyzing `example.com`:

```
DNS Records Analysis for example.com:

MX Record(s):
mail.example.com.

SPF Record(s):
v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all

Authorized senders/IPs from SPF record:
Including domain: _spf.google.com

DKIM Record(s):
DKIM record for selector default: ['v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGf...']

DMARC Record(s):
v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@example.com

DNSSEC Record(s):
Not Found

Possible vulnerabilities:
Only one MX record found.
SPF record has softfail (~all).
DMARC policy is 'none'. It is recommended to set 'p=quarantine' or 'p=reject'.
DNSSEC is not enabled. No DNSKEY records found.
```
